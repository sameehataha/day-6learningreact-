Circle Toggle
A simple React application that displays a row of interactive circles that can be toggled on and off. Each circle starts with a predefined state (on or off) and changes color when clicked. When a circle is "on", it displays with a blue background (#0066cc), and when "off", it appears transparent with just a black border.
Features
6 clickable circles arranged horizontally
Toggle functionality - click any circle to switch its state
Visual feedback with color changes (blue for active, transparent for inactive)
Clean, minimalist design with CSS styling
